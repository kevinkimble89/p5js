# P5.js Assignment

The canvas contains:
1) A diamond object that moves to the right and back to the left (loop). As it moves, it also changes color from dark to white and vice versa.
2) A text element that displays my name when you hover the mouse pointer within the canvas. The text follows wherever the mouse pointer goes. The text properties (font, size, style, color) change when mouse is pressed and goes back to previous properties when unpressed.
